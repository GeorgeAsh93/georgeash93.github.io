# Disc Golf Leadership

<img src="{{site.url}}/images/hobbies/9-holes.PNG" alt="Us at Hobbiton" style="width: 250px;" align="right"/>

I started playing disc golf in 2009 as a freshman at the Santa Cruz. I very quickly took over many leadership roles on the team including organizing tournaments, weekly practices, and raised money for the team. During my tenure as a leader of the team I worked with multiple organziations on campus to get a disc golf course on campus approved. It took many hours of campainging and organization but in the end the disc golf course was approved.
